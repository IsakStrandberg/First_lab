I did not manage to figure out how to convert char to int and string and loop it to make half a pyramid unfortunetly, im submitting this early tonight
incase i forget to try and solve my problem after my break.

I learnt how to use printf/scanf, tho i would want to use them as little as possible in the future, i knew how to do loops from c# i did a year ago,
the bounce task i had done in python just about two months ago so that went easy but just thinking on how to get the prime numbers task to work was a hassle.
I overcame this issue by googling my problems and asking for ideas from my classmates but i could definetly improve the overall structure to make it easier 
to read and it could definetly do with alot of error handling.

Ultimetly i probably spent around 13 hours on this task.
